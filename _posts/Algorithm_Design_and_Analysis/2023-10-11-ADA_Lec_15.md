This blog will talking about a randomized rounding algorithm.

<!--more-->

In [Algorithm ${ 1 }$](https://wu-haonan.github.io/2023/10/02/ADA_Lec_12.html#deterministic-rounding-algorithm), we round a variable ${ x_j^\* }$ to ${ 1 }$ if ${ x_j^\* \geq \frac{1}{f} }$. 

For randomized Algorithm, we will decided the way to round the variable by probability. For variable ${ x_j^\* }$ we will define a random variable ${ X_j }$, and define ${ Pr[X_j = 1] = x_j^\* }$, ${ Pr[X_j = 0] = 1- x_j^\* }$.

<b>The expected value of the objective is optimal by linearity expectation. </b>

<center>$$
E\left[\sum_{j=1}^m w_j X_j \right] = \sum_{j=1}^m w_j Pr[X_j = 1] = \sum_{j=1}^m w_j x_j^*  = Z_{LP}^*
$$</center>

However, the solution is feasible with very low probability.

<center>$$
Pr[e_i \text{ is not covered}] = \prod_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} 1 - x_j^*
$$</center>

And we know ${\forall x \in [0,1], 1 -x \leq e^{-x} }$. Thus we have,

<center>$$
Pr[e_i \text{ is not covered}] = \prod_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} 1 - x_j^* \leq \prod_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} e^{-x_j^*} = e^{-\sum_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} x_j^*}
$$</center>

And by LP constraint, we have ${ \sum_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} x_j^* \geq 1 }$, so 

<center>$$
Pr[e_i \text{ is not covered}] = \prod_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} 1 - x_j^* \leq \prod_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} e^{-x_j^*} = e^{-\sum_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} x_j^*} \leq e^{-1}
$$</center>

# Algorithm ${ 6 }$

Step 1: Solve the relaxed LP

Step 2: add ${ j }$ to solution ${ I }$ with probability ${ \min \\{ 1, K x_j^\*\\} }$. (take ${ K = c \ln n, c\geq 2 }$)

# High probability of feasible solution

For any element ${ e_i }$, <b>if</b> ${ K x_j^\* \geq 1 }$ for some ${ j }$ such that ${ e_i \in S_j }$, then ${ S_j }$ covers ${ e_i }$. <b>Else</b>, we have

<center>$$
Pr[e_i \text{ is not covered}] = \prod_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} 1 - K x_j^* \leq \prod_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} e^{- K x_j^*} = e^{-\sum_{j \in \{e_i \in S_j\}} K x_j^*} \leq e^{-K}
$$</center>

Because, ${ K = c \ln n }$, we get 

<center>$$
Pr[e_i \text{ is not covered}] \leq e^{-K} = n^{-c}
$$</center>

By union bound (Boole's inequality), we have 

<center>$$
Pr[\text{there exists some uncovered element}] =  Pr\left[\bigcup_{e_i \in E } e_i \text{ is not covered}\right] \leq \sum_{i=1}^n Pr[e_i \text{ is not covered}]\leq \sum_{i=1}^n n^{-c} = n^{-c+1}
$$</center>

For ${ c \geq 2 }$, the probability to produce feasible solution is at least ${ 1 - \frac{1}{n} }$

# Algorithm ${ 6 }$ is ${ 2c \ln n }$-approximation

It's easy to get the expectation of all solution

<center>$$
E\left[\sum_{j=1}^m w_j X_j \right] = \sum_{j=1}^m w_j Pr[X_j = 1] \leq \sum_{j=1}^m w_j K x_j^*  = K Z_{LP}^*
$$</center>

However, we would like to bound the expecatation of feasible solution, let ${ F }$ be the event that solution is feasible, and ${ \bar{F} }$ be complement of this event. We know 

<center>$$
E\left[\sum_{j=1}^m w_j X_j \right] = E\left[\sum_{j=1}^m w_j X_j \middle| F \right] Pr[F] + E\left[\sum_{j=1}^m w_j X_j \middle| \bar{F} \right] Pr[\bar{F}] \geq E\left[\sum_{j=1}^m w_j X_j \middle| F \right] Pr[F]
$$</center>

Hence, we have 

<center>$$
E\left[\sum_{j=1}^m w_j X_j \middle| F \right] \leq \frac{1}{Pr[F]} E\left[\sum_{j=1}^m w_j X_j \right] \leq \frac{c \ln n Z_
{LP}^*}{1 - n^{1-c}} \leq \frac{c \ln n Z_{LP}^*}{1 - n^{-1}} \leq \frac{c \ln n Z_{LP}^*}{1 - 2^{-1}} = 2 c \ln n Z_{LP}^* \leq 2 c \ln n Z_{ILP}^* =2 c \ln n OPT
