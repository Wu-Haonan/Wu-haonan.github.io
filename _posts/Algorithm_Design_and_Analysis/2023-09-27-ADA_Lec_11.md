# ${ \alpha }$-approximation algorithm

An ${ \alpha }$-approximation algorithm for an optimization problem is <b>a polynomial-time algorithm</b> that for all instances of the problem produces a solution for which the value is within a factor of ${ \alpha }$ of the value of an optimal solution.

For ${ \alpha }$-approximation algorithm, that means:

1. The algorithm runs in polynomial time.

2. The algorithm always produces a feasible solution.

3. The value is within a factor ${ \alpha }$ of the value of an optimal solution. (Here, ${ \alpha >1 }$, ${ OPT(I) }$ means the optimal solution of instance ${ I }$, and ${ A(I) }$ means the value generated by approximation algorithm ${ A }$ of instance ${ I }$.)

    * For max optimization ${ \frac{OPT(I)}{A(I)} \leq \alpha }$

    * For min optimization ${ \frac{A(I)}{OPT(I)} \leq \alpha }$

And a common stratege for prove an approximation algorithm within a factor ${ \alpha }$ is (take min optimazation as an example): 

1. Find an lower bound ${ u }$ of ${ OPT }$, that is ${ OPT \geq u }$

2. Find an upper bound ${ l }$ of ${ A }$, that is ${ l \geq A }$

3. Prove ${ l \leq \alpha u }$, that is ${ A \leq l \leq \alpha u \leq OPT }$


# LP techniques (Vertex Cover as Example)

Let's consider vertex cover problem.

Give a graph ${ G=(V,E) }$, find a subset of vertices ${ S \subseteq V }$, such that each edge has an endpoint in the set ${ S }$. Our goal is to minimize ${ \vert S \vert }$.

## Algorithm ${ \mathcal{A} }$

Find a maximal matching ${ M }$ and add all endpoints of the edges in ${ M }$ to ${ S }$.

Steps: Choose the edges one by one (if the egde is compatiable to already-selected edges) until no edges can be added anymore.

<b>Therorem:</b> Algorithm ${ \mathcal{A} }$ is a ${ 2 }$-approximation algorithm of Vertex Cover Problem.

Proof.

1. Polynomial run-time: It's clear to see the number of loops is ${ O(\vert E \vert ) }$.

2. Feasibility: Suppose there exists edge ${ e \in E }$ that is not covered, that means both endpoints of ${ e }$ are not in ${ S }$. So ${ e\notin M }$. Then we can add ${ e }$ to ${ M }$, because ${ e }$ don't have any overlap endpoints with ${ M }$. So, we get a bigger matching which contradicts to ${ M }$ is maximal matching. 

3. ${ 2 }$-approximation: 
    * The edges in ${ M }$ can not share endpoints to each other, that implies ${ \vert S \vert = 2 \vert M \vert }$.
    * The optimal vertex cover needs to cover all the edges in ${ M }$, that means the optimal solution have to contain at least one endpoint of each edge in ${ M }$. And all edges in ${ M }$ can not share endpoints to each other. So ${ OPT \geq \vert M \vert }$
    * ${ \vert S \vert = 2 \vert M \vert \leq 2 OPT }$, that is ${ \frac{S}{OPT} \leq 2 }$

Hence, Algorithm ${ \mathcal{A} }$ is a ${ 2 }$-approximation algorithm. ${ \square }$

## Algorithm ${ \mathcal{B} }$

First we formulate the vertex cover problem as Integer Linear Programming (ILP)

For each vertex ${ v_i \in V}$, we set indicator variable ${ x_i \in \\{0,1\\} }$ to represent if we selected vertex ${ v_i }$.

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\text{minimize} && Z = \sum_{j=1}^{\vert V \vert } x_j \\
&\text{subject to} && x_i + x_j \geq 1, \quad \forall e =\{v_i,v_j\} \in E\\
& && x_j \in \{0,1\}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

ILP cannot be solved in polynomial time, then we relax it to LP Problem.

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\text{minimize} && Z = \sum_{j=1}^{\vert V \vert } x_j \\
&\text{subject to} && x_i + x_j \geq 1, \quad \forall e =\{v_i,v_j\} \in E\\
& && x_j \geq 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

But after solving LP Problem, some of the decision variables are fractions. Hence we need to decide each variable is set to ${ 0 }$ or ${ 1 }$. In other words, how to decided the threshold. The way to decide the threshold will induce to many different approximation algorithms. Here, we set threshold as ${ 1/2 }$ (Because we have constrain ${ x\_i + x\_j \geq 1 }$ need to satisify, we will show it in detail in next proof). Here, we denote the optimal solution as ${ x\_1^\*, x\_2^\*, \cdots, x\_n^\* }$, and the integer solution as ${\hat{x}\_1,\hat{x}\_2,\cdots,\hat{x}\_n}$

<b>Theorem:</b> Algorithm ${ \mathcal{B} }$ is a ${ 2 }$-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover Problem.

Proof. 

1. Polynomial Run-time: the relexed LP problem can be solved in polynomiak time and the seting each decision variable to integer takes ${O(n)}$ time.  

2. Feasibility: For each edge ${ e= (i,j)}$, we have to meet the constraint in relaxed LP problem, that is ${x\_i^\*+x\_j^\* \geq 1}$. So, we have either ${x\_i^\* \geq 1/2}$ or ${x\_j^\* \geq 1/2}$ (otherwise ${ x\_i^\*+x\_j^\* \leq 1 }$).

3. ${ 2 }$-approximation: for each ${ \hat{x_j} }$, if ${ x\_j^\* \geq 1/2 }$, ${ \hat{x_j} = 1 }$, else ${ \hat{x_j} = 0 }$. And we know the minimum value of ILP ${ Z^\*\_{ILP} }$ will not less than the minimum value of LP ${ Z^\*\_{LP} }$ (because the feasible region of ILP is the subset of the feasible region of LP). Hence, we have

<center>$$
\vert S \vert = \sum_{j=1}^n \hat{x}_j \leq 2 \sum_{j=1}^n x^*_j = 2Z^*_{LP}\leq 2 Z^*_{ILP} = 2 OPT
$$</center>

Hence we prove that Algorithm ${ \mathcal{B} }$ is a ${ 2 }$-approximation algorithm. ${ \square }$

## Algorithm ${ \mathcal{B} }$ for weighted vertex cover

Considering the weighted vertex cover problem, we assign a weight to each vertex and want to minimize the total weight of vertex cover.

Now we can consider the ILP problem as below

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\text{minimize} && Z = \sum_{j=1}^{\vert V \vert } w_j x_j \\
&\text{subject to} && x_i + x_j \geq 1, \quad \forall e =\{v_i,v_j\} \in E\\
& && x_j \in \{0,1\}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

And the relaxed LP problem as

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\text{minimize} && Z = \sum_{j=1}^{\vert V \vert } w_j x_j \\
&\text{subject to} && x_i + x_j \geq 1, \quad \forall e =\{v_i,v_j\} \in E\\
& && x_j \geq 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

We can use Algorithm ${ \mathcal{B} }$ for weighted vertex cover problem, and we can prove it's still a ${ 2 }$-approximation algorithm by similar proof.

<center>$$
\sum_{j\in S} w_j = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j \hat{x}_j \leq 2 \sum_{j=1}^n w_j x^*_j = 2Z^*_{LP}\leq 2 Z^*_{ILP} = 2 OPT
$$</center>
