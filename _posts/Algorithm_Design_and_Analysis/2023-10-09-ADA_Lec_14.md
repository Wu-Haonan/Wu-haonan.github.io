# Gready algorithm for unweighted set cover

## Algorithm ${ 4 }$

Let ${ \hat{S_j} }$ be set of uncovered items in ${ S_j }$ at any step of any step.

Step 1: ${ I = \emptyset }$, ${\forall j=1,2, \cdots, m }$ let ${ \hat{S_j} = S_j }$

Step 2: while some ${ e_i }$ is uncovered 

* add ${ \ell }$ to ${ I }$, here ${  \lvert \hat{S_{\ell}} \lvert }$ is maximum.

* for all ${ j }$, update ${ \hat{S_j} }$

## Algorithm ${ 4 }$ is ${ H_n }$-approximation algorithm

<b>Claim 1</b>: Let ${ k_i }$ be the number of uncovered element before just ${ e_i }$ gets covered. ${ \sum_{i=1}^n 1/ k_i \leq H_n }$, here ${ H_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} \approx \ln n  }$

Proof. without loss of generality, elements are covered in order ${ e_n, e_{n-1},\cdots, e_1 }$.

Before ${ e_i }$ gets covered, at least ${ i }$ elements are still uncovered, that means ${ k_i \geq i }$.

Hence, ${ \sum_{i=1}^n 1/ k_i \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} = H_n}$. ${ \square }$

<b>Lemma 1</b>: Let ${ A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_q }$ be finite sets. Then ${ \sum_{j=1}^q \vert A_j \vert \geq \vert \bigcup_{j=1}^q  A_j \vert }$

Proof. it's trivial to get. ${ \square }$

<b>Claim 2</b>: When adding ${ S_{\ell} }$, for each new item ${ e_i \in \hat{S_{\ell}} }$ let ${ y_i = \frac{1}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert} }$. We have ${ y_i \leq \frac{OPT}{k_i} }$

Proof. Take arbitrary element ${ e_i \in S_{\ell} }$. For any ${ j = 1,2,\cdots, m}$, let ${ \hat{S_j} }$ be the set of uncovered element in ${ S_j }$, just before ${ e_i }$ gets covered.

By the selection rule of algorithm, ${\forall j,  \vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert \geq \vert \hat{S_j} \vert }$. (here notice that if some ${ \hat{S_j}=\emptyset }$, we still have ${\forall j,  \vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert \geq \vert \hat{S_j} \vert = 0}$

Let ${ I' }$ be an optimal solution ${ OPT = \vert I' \vert = \sum_{j \in I'} 1 \geq \sum_{j \in I'} \frac{\vert \hat{S_j} \vert}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert} =  \frac{1}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } \sum_{j \in I'} \vert \hat{S_j} \vert }$  

By lemma 1, we have ${ \frac{1}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } \sum_{j \in I'} \vert \hat{S_j} \vert \geq \frac{1}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert }  \lvert \bigcup_{j \in I'} \hat{S_j} \rvert  }$. Here ${ \bigcup_{j \in I'} \hat{S_j} }$ is exactly ${ k_i }$ (the number of uncovered element before just ${ e_i }$ gets covered). And by definition, ${ y_i = \frac{1}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } }$, we have 

<center>$$
OPT = \vert I' \vert = \sum_{j \in I'} 1 \geq \sum_{j \in I'} \frac{\vert \hat{S_j} \vert}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert} =  \frac{1}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } \sum_{j \in I'} \vert \hat{S_j} \vert \geq  \frac{1}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert }  \lvert \bigcup_{j \in I'} \hat{S_j} \rvert = \frac{1}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } k_i = y_i k_i
$$</center>

So, we get ${ y_i \leq \frac{OPT}{k_i} }$. ${ \square }$

<b>Theorem</b>: Algorithm ${ 4 }$ ${ H_n }$-approximates the optimal set cover

1. Polynomial Run-time: it's clearly in polynomial time

2. Feasibility: by the termination condition, we will cover all the elements in ${ E }$.

3. ${ H_n }$-approximation: 

When we add a new set ${ S_{\ell} }$, we divide its cost (here is ${ 1 }$) to all newly covered elements. Hence, for each new item ${ e_i \in \hat{S_{\ell}} }$, its take cost ${ y_i = \frac{1}{\hat{S_{\ell}}} }$. Because, we add cost to each item. So, ${ \vert I \vert = \sum_{i =1}^n y_i }$. By claim 2, we have 

<center>$$
 \vert I \vert = \sum_{i =1}^n y_i \leq \sum_{i =1}^n \frac{OPT}{k_i} = OPT \cdot \sum_{i =1}^n \frac{1}{k_i} \leq H_n \cdot OPT
$$</center>

Hence, Algorithm ${ 4 }$ is ${ H_n }$-approximation algorithm. ${ \square }$

# Gready algorithm for weighted set cover

## Algorithm ${ 5 }$

Let ${ \hat{S_j} }$ be set of uncovered items in ${ S_j }$ at any step of any step.

Step 1: ${ I = \emptyset }$, ${\forall j=1,2, \cdots, m }$ let ${ \hat{S_j} = S_j }$

Step 2: while some ${ e_i }$ is uncovered 

* add ${ \ell }$ to ${ I }$, here ${  \frac{w_{\ell}}{\lvert \hat{S_{\ell}} \lvert} }$ is minimum.

* for all ${ j }$, update ${ \hat{S_j} }$

## Algorithm ${ 5 }$ is ${ H_n }$-approximation algorithm

<b>Claim 3</b>: When adding ${ S_{\ell} }$, for each new item ${ e_i \in \hat{S_{ell}} }$ let ${ y_i = \frac{w_{\ell}}{\hat{S_{\ell}}} }$. We have ${ y_i \leq \frac{OPT}{k_i} }$

Proof. Take arbitrary element ${ e_i \in S_{\ell} }$. For any ${ j = 1,2,\cdots, m}$, let ${ \hat{S_j} }$ be the set of uncovered element in ${ S_j }$, just before ${ e_i }$ gets covered.

By the selection rule of algorithm, ${\forall j,\vert  \hat{S_{j}} \vert \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert} \leq w_j }$. (here notice that if some ${ \hat{S_j}=\emptyset }$, we still have ${\forall j,0= \vert\hat{S_{j}} \vert \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert} \leq w_j }$

Let ${ I' }$ be an optimal solution ${ OPT = \vert I' \vert = \sum_{j \in I'} w_j \geq \sum_{j \in I'} w_{\ell} \frac{\vert \hat{S_j} \vert}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert} =  \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } \sum_{j \in I'} \vert \hat{S_j} \vert }$  

By lemma 1, we have ${ \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } \sum_{j \in I'} \vert \hat{S_j} \vert \geq \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert }  \lvert \bigcup_{j \in I'} \hat{S_j} \rvert  }$. Here ${ \bigcup_{j \in I'} \hat{S_j} }$ is exactly ${ k_i }$ (the number of uncovered element before just ${ e_i }$ gets covered). And by definition, ${ y_i = \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } }$, we have 

<center>$$
OPT = \sum_{j \in I'} w_j \geq \sum_{j \in I'} w_{\ell} \frac{\vert \hat{S_j} \vert}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert} =  \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } \sum_{j \in I'} \vert \hat{S_j} \vert \geq  \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert }  \lvert \bigcup_{j \in I'} \hat{S_j} \rvert = \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } k_i = y_i k_i
$$</center>

So, we get ${ y_i \leq \frac{OPT}{k_i} }$. ${ \square }$

Hence, for each new item ${ e_i \in \hat{S_{\ell}} }$, its take cost ${ y_i = \frac{1}{\hat{S_{\ell}}} }$. Because, we add cost to each item. So, ${ \sum_{j \in I} w_j = \sum_{i =1}^n y_i }$. By claim 2, we have 

<center>$$
  \sum_{j \in I} w_j = \sum_{i =1}^n y_i \leq \sum_{i =1}^n \frac{OPT}{k_i} = OPT \cdot \sum_{i =1}^n \frac{1}{k_i} \leq H_n \cdot OPT
$$</center>

Hence, Algorithm ${ 5 }$ is ${ H_n }$-approximation algorithm. ${ \square }$

# Dual fitting

Using dual LP for analysis, we can get better approximation bound

Let ${ S_j = \\{e_1, e_2, \cdots, e_{\vert S_j\vert} \\} }$. And we assume the they are covered in order ${ e_{\vert S_j\vert}, e_{\vert S_j\vert-1}, \cdots, e_1 }$

For element ${ e_i }$, just before ${ e_i }$ gets covered, the number of uncovered items in ${ S_j }$ at least ${ i }$, that is ${ \vert \hat{S_j} \vert \geq i }$.

Let ${ e_i }$ is covered by selecting ${ S_{\ell} }$ in some loop of algorithm. We have ${ y_i := \frac{w_{\ell}}{\vert \hat{S_{\ell}} \vert } \leq \frac{w_{j}}{\vert \hat{S_{j}} \vert } \leq \frac{w_{j}}{i }   }$

Let ${ g = \max_j \vert S_j \vert }$, we have ${ \sum_{i \in \\{i \mid e_i \in S_j\\}} y_i = \sum_{i=1}^{\vert S_j\vert } y_i \leq \sum_{i=1}^{\vert S_j\vert } \frac{w_j}{i} = w_j H_{\vert S_j\vert } \leq w_j H_g}$

Let ${\forall i, y'_i = \frac{y_i}{H_g} }$, ${ y' }$ is a feasible solution.

So, total cost ${ \sum_{j \in I}^n w_j = \sum_{i =1}^n y_i = H_g \sum_{i =1}^n y'\_i \leq H_g Z_D^\* = H_g Z_{LP}^\* =  H_g Z_{ILP}^\* \leq H_g \cdot OPT}$.

Hence, we use dual fiiting get a better bound, Algorithm ${ 5 }$ is ${ H_g }$-approximation algorithm.
