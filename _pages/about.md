Hi guys! I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Medvedev](https://medvedevgroup.com/principal-investigator/). 

Previously, I obtained my M.S. in [Operations Research (OR)](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn/English/Introduction.htm) and B.S. in [Biotechnology](https://mc.wh.sdu.edu.cn/ENGLISH/Introduction.htm) at [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/). 

# Research interests

I am interested in developing algorithms/tools/theories for bioinformatics and addressing biological problems via these methods. So, I aim to 

1. Design methods with solid math/algorithms or at least mathematical intuition.
2. Build practically useful tools with heuristics benefiting the bio/bioinfo communities. 

Currently, I am working on estimating distance by an alignment-free method and building theories behind common heuristics applied in alignment tools.
